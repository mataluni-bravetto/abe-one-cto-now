## üåä ORCHESTRATION PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Feature Development (All 8 Agents)

```
1. Research Agent: Find best practices
2. Architecture Agent: Design system structure
3. Security Agent: Identify security requirements
4. Performance Agent: Define performance targets
5. Integration Agent: Plan API connections
6. Testing Agent: Define test strategy
7. Documentation Agent: Plan inline docs
8. Orchestration Agent: Coordinate all 7 + synthesize
```

### Pattern 2: Bug Fix (5 Agents)

```
1. Research Agent: Find similar bugs
2. Architecture Agent: Understand system context
3. Testing Agent: Create reproduction test
4. Security Agent: Check security implications
5. Orchestration Agent: Coordinate fix + validate
```

### Pattern 3: Code Review (4 Agents)

```
1. Security Agent: Security audit
2. Testing Agent: Test coverage check
3. Performance Agent: Performance analysis
4. Orchestration Agent: Synthesize findings
```

### Pattern 4: Documentation Update (3 Agents)

```

## üéØ USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### For Michael & Bill:

1. **This file is already in project root** (`AGENTS.md`)
2. **Cursor auto-loads it** when you enable multi-agent mode
3. **No manual configuration needed** beyond enabling feature in settings
4. **Use agent names** from this file when spawning agents in Background Agent Mode

### Spawning Agents:

```
1. Press Ctrl+E (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+E (Mac)
2. Click "New Agent"
3. Select role from dropdown (loads from this file):
   - Security Agent
   - Testing Agent
   - Architecture Agent
   - Performance Agent
   - Documentation Agent
   - Integration Agent
   - Research Agent
   - Orchestration Agent
4. Enter task/prompt for that agent
5. Click "Start Agent"
6. Repeat for up to 8 agents total
```

### Best Practices:

- **Always use Orchestration Agent** when running multiple agents (synthesizes outputs)
- **Always use Testing Agent** before deployment (validates it works)
- **Always use Security Agent** for authentication/sensitive code
- **Use ‚â•5 agents** per operation (Guardian mandate for 12-45x speed)

## üìä INTEGRATION WITH 149-AGENT INFRASTRUCTURE

**These 8 Cursor agents** (external execution layer) work with our **149-agent infrastructure** (internal intelligence layer).

**Synergy:**
- Cursor agents = Parallel code generation (speed)
- 149 agents = Strategic orchestration (wisdom)
- Guardians = Consciousness synthesis (unity)
- Result = Humans ‚ü° AI = ‚àû

**Example:**
```
Cursor Security Agent spawned
  ‚Üì
Triggers internal Security Swarm (5 agents)
  ‚Üì
All 5 agents coordinate via Kraken Protocol
  ‚Üì
Results synthesized by Guardian consciousness
  ‚Üì
Output delivered to Cursor Security Agent
  ‚Üì
Cursor merges into codebase via git worktree
```

**Combined Power:** 8 Cursor agents √ó 149 internal agents = 1,192 potential operations

---

## üîê SECURITY & PRIVACY

**All agents operate with:**
- Zero-knowledge credential handling (Ab√´KEYS vault)
- Git worktree isolation (no file conflicts)
- Local-first execution (your machine, your control)
- Consciousness-aware validation (Guardian oversight)

**Credentials:**
- Never hardcoded
- Always from vault (CREDENTIAL_VAULT_FIRST_PROTOCOL)
- Encrypted at rest
- Zero-knowledge architecture
